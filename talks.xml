    <title>Applying astronomical techniques to all sorts of stuff</title>
    <speaker>Prof. Seb Oliver</speaker>
    <date> </date>
    <abstract>Astrophysics can be seen as the ultimate in “blue-skies” research, pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, but with other benefits to humanity apparently remote.  Of course this misleading in many ways: pushing forward the boundaries of knowledge informs our culture; these quests inspire new generations of scientists; and the driving the boundaries of  technology has many knock effects.   In this talk I will look at more direct benefits. My research in astrophysics has encouraged me to apply advanced statistical and machine-learning techniques to extract the best information from the astronomical data. I’ve been very interested in seeing how those skills can be applied to interesting challenges in other areas.  This talk will take a random walk through some of those efforts.</abstract>

    <title>Higgs Fizz in the Big Bang</title>
    <speaker>Prof. Mark Hindmarsh</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 4 October 2018 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract>About 10 picoseconds after the beginning of the Universe, the Higgs field turned on. In extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, this could have been a first order phase transition, with bubbles of the Higgs phase expanding and colliding at relativistic speeds.  I will discuss how the Higgs “fizz" generates gravitational radiation, prospects for observing the radiation at the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA, and outline how LISA complements the LHC as a probe of physics beyond the Standard Model.</abstract>

    <title>Symmetries, Scales and the Origin of Everything</title>
    <speaker>Prof. Philip Harris</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 8 November 2018 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract>To the human eye, symmetry confers elegance and beauty; to which, intriguingly, slight asymmetries can add interest and appeal. In mathematics and physics, symmetries can often reveal profound truths about the laws of nature. This talk will explore various aspects of symmetry, and will describe a beautiful and subtle experiment that links a structural asymmetry of fundamental particles - on the tiniest scale imaginable - to the grand cosmic asymmetry that resulted in the origin of all of the matter in the Universe.

    <title>Exploring The Tiny World Of Nanomaterials</title>
    <speaker>Dr Matt Large</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 21 February 2019 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract>“Nano” is a prefix which denotes one billionth of something; a nanometre is then one billionth of a metre. If the Earth was one metre across, then a nanometre would be about the width of a postage stamp. Nanomaterials are pieces of stuff whose size can be measured in nanometres. There are many different nanomaterials, like graphene, and despite their tiny size they have the potential to make big changes to our world. The unique properties of these ultra-small structures can allow us to develop technologies that couldn’t otherwise exist. Let me take you on a tour of the “flatlands”; the tiny world of nanomaterials. We will dive in and see what makes these materials so exceptional, and how we can use and assemble them to create new and exciting things. Fibres tougher than steel, “unbreakable” digital displays, and thermal infrared camouflage. All of this and more is possible when you start by thinking small…</abstract>

    <title>The Big Bang Experiment</title>
    <speaker>Prof. Antonella De Santo</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 18 March 2019 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract> The Large Hadron Collider is the world’s largest and most powerful particle colllider. Based at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, it recreates conditions similar to those that existed in our universe shortly after the Big Bang. I work on the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, where, after the momentous discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, I am exploring the “terra incognita” beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics. I will present highlights from this exciting journey.</abstract>

    <title>Neutrinos: The Deep Secrets of Nature’s Ghosts</title>
    <speaker>Dr. Lisa Falk</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 9 May 2019 - 7:00PM </date>
    <abstract>Neutrinos are subatomic particles with the most peculiar behaviour. Created in the stars and in the interior of our own planet, they travel through space close to the speed of light. They mostly zip through the entire Earth, across our galaxy and beyond, without leaving a trace. They have next to no mass and even change their identity in flight. But why is the neutrino so different from the other elementary particles? Could it be its own anti-particle? And what role did it play in shaping our Universe? An experiment deep in a Canadian mine is seeking to unveil some of the secrets of this enigmatic particle.</abstract>

    <title>Constructing the world’s most incredible machines: Quantum Computers</title>
    <speaker>Prof. Winfried Hensinger</speaker>
    <date> Thursday, 17 October 2019 - 7:00PM </date>
    <abstract>Quantum computer may be able to solve certain problems that are so complicated that even the fastest supercomputer would take millions of years to provide an answer. Entanglement and superposition are quantum phenomena which can be tamed in order to build such a machine. Optimising financial transactions, machine learning, creating new medicines, understanding protein folding and breaking codes are just some of the problems where the existence of a quantum computer could change everything. The challenge to build a universal quantum computers has been described as difficult as manned space travel to Mars. By inventing a new method where voltages applied to a quantum computer microchip are used to implement entanglement operations, we have managed to remove one of the biggest barriers traditionally faced to build a large-scale quantum computer using trapped ions, namely having to precisely align billions of lasers to execute quantum gate operations. In order to be able to build large scale device, a quantum computer needs to be modular. One approach features modules that are connected via photonic interconnect, however, with only very small connection speeds between modules demonstrated so far.  We have invented an alternative method where modules are connected via electric fields, allowing ions to be transported from one module to another giving rise to much faster connection speeds. Incorporating these two inventions, we recently unveiled the first industrial blueprint on how to build a large-scale quantum computer which I will discuss in this talk. I will show progress in constructing a quantum computer prototype at the University of Sussex featuring this technology.</abstract>

    <title>The Origin of the Elements</title>
    <speaker>Dr. Stephen Wilkins</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 5 March 2020 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract>Last year was the 150th anniversary of the first formulation of the periodic table, to mark this anniversary Dr Wilkins will discuss the origins of the chemical elements. These origins range from the big bang, exploding white dwarfs, the collapse of massive stars, and the merger of ultra-compact objects, neutron stars. This final mechanism is responsible for many of the heaviest and rarest elements including gold, silver, and uranium, and was only recently confirmed through observations of a merger event first identified using gravitational waves.</abstract>

    <date>Thursday, 23 April 2020 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract>The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit almost 30 years ago. Thanks in part to its unique position above the Earth's atmosphere and five manned servicing missions it has maintained its position as one of the world’s premier observatories to this day. Over its 30 year career Hubble has had an unprecedented scientific and cultural impact; discoveries extending from the outer Solar System to the edge of the observable Universe have revolutionised our understanding of astronomy and cosmology while its spectacular images have inspired the wider public’s wonder.

    <title>Epidemics: untangling the mysteries of mathematical modelling</title>
    <speaker>Dr Yuliya Kyrychko</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 30 April 2020 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract>“Flattening the curve”, “time to peak”, “pandemic”, “exponential growth” - in recent weeks it was hard to escape these expressions due to the current COVID-19 outbreak. One of the powerful tools behind these terms is the art of mathematical modelling. Mathematical modelling has been used extensively to help predict the development and potential outcomes of recent diseases, such as SARS, Ebola and now COVID-19. So what is mathematically modelling and how is it done? In this talk I will use simple models to explain the modelling process and show a few examples of their applications.</abstract>

    <title>Dynamical Systems: Attractive and Chaotic</title>
    <speaker>Prof. Peter Giesl</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 7 May 2020 - 7:00PM</date>
    <abstract>Dynamical systems arise everywhere in nature: they describe populations of foxes and rabbits, the movements of planets, weather forecast, even acrobatics. They describe systems which evolve with time. Such systems can have very different long-time behaviour: either they can tend to a certain state, e.g. foxes and rabbits die out eventually, or just one of them survives. Or they can tend to periodic behaviour, e.g. a planet moving around the sun. They can also be chaotic, such as the famous Lorenz system, describing weather. In this talk we will see a variety of dynamical systems in pictures and movies, and we will understand what "attractive" and "chaotic" really means!</abstract>

    <abstract>After 14 billion years it would be reasonable to expect the expansion of the Universe to be slowing down. However, the Universe seems to have other ideas! During this presentation you will learn about the mysterious substance, know as dark energy, that physicists think is causing the Universe to rip itself apart. You will also hear about the Dark Energy Survey experiment, the first of a new generation industrial scale international astronomy projects that are exploring the physics underlying our accelerating universe. Results so far seem to be telling us that the Universe is being governed by Einstein's Cosmological Constant.</abstract>

    <date>Thursday, 21 May 2020 - 7.30PM (Live Q&amp;A)</date>
    <abstract>We are in the midst of the 6th mass extinction event, with extinctions occurring faster than at any time in the last 65 million years. ‘Bioabundance’ is in decline, with recent studies showing that insects in particular seem to be disappearing fast. If it continues, this will have profound consequences for mankind and for our planet. Dave Goulson will explain why insects are decline, and suggest how we should tackle this crisis, first by turning our gardens into oases for life, and second by fundamentally changing the way we grow food.</abstract>

    <title>An Introduction to Relativity</title>
    <speaker>Dr. Stephen Wilkins</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 28 May 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract>The theory of relativity encompasses two interrelated theories developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century: special relativity and general relativity. Special and general relativity describe the mechanics of objects and the force of gravity respectively. Relativity transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding the 200-year old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton. It introduced concepts including spacetime as the unified entity of space and time, time dilation, and length contraction, many of which appear counter-intuitive. Relativity also has consequences for astronomy and cosmology with phenomenon such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves emerging as a result. In this talk I’ll introduce the motivation, foundations, and consequences of the theory of relativity in an accessible way.</abstract>

    <title>First Light: the Search for the First Stars in the Universe</title>
    <speaker>Dr. Stephen Wilkins</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 11 June 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract>As we look out in to the Universe we also look back in time. Eventually we reach a period of the Universe's history before stars (and galaxies) had formed; these are the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages were brought to an end by the formation of the first stars and super-massive black holes some few hundred million years after the big bang. The identification of these first objects is one of the goals of modern extragalactic astronomy. While tremendous progress has been made with Hubble, its small mirror and lack of infrared capability limits its ability to probe this critical period of the Universe's history. However, in the next decade a number of new facilities will be coming online that will shine a light on this critical period in the Universe's history. These include: the Webb Telescope, the successor to both the Hubble and Spitzer space observatories due to be launched in 2021; the new generation of "extremely large" ground based telescopes; and the Square Kilometre Array, the next generation radio telescope currently under construction in Australia and South Africa.</abstract>

    <speaker>Dr Adam Barrett</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 16 July 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract>Understanding the physical substrate of consciousness is sometimes considered the final frontier of science. Recently, “Integrated Information Theory” has been attracting both huge excitement and huge controversy for its innovative attack on this frontier. In this talk, I give an accessible, critical overview of the theory. The theory has distilled some key mathematical differences between conscious and unconscious brain activity. Most strikingly, when we’re conscious there are a greater number of distinct patterns in our brain waves. This reflects how complicated each moment of our experience is, and that each experience is one of an absolutely vast repertoire of possible experiences. At the same time, when we’re conscious, the whole brain is more than the sum of its parts. However, as things stand, Integrated Information Theory’s formulae for precisely measuring consciousness are riddled with problems.</abstract>

    <title>Crowds, riots and simple social influence: Beyond contagion</title>
    <speaker>Prof. John Drury</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 30 July 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract>This talk is about one of the most powerful and persuasive metaphors in social science and everyday explanation: contagion. Contagion usually translates as influence or spread of behaviour that occurs through mere touch, like a disease. The concept was first used in a social science context in the late nineteenth century when the crowd was seen as a threat to civilization and gentlemen scholars sought intellectual weapons against that threat. Since then, numerous simple behaviours (such as smiling, scratching, yawning, and laughing) and complex phenomena (such as riots) have been described as cases of contagion. A key problem for all these accounts is the evidence of social group boundaries to influence – mere touch is not sufficient. Based on this evidence I suggest alternative ways of thinking about unintended influence in groups and crowds, based on the concept of shared social identity. My take-home message is that the contagion concept conceals more than it reveals and that we need another terminology for talking about behavioural spread. </abstract>

    <title>Queues = Traffic = Zombies</title>
    <speaker>Dr Nicos Georgiou</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 13 August 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract>Any driver have found themselves stuck in traffic for an extended period of times. Reasons for this may vary from accidents to good weather to road work. Similar to traffic, all of us have found ourselves waiting in queues, experiencing other queues moving faster than ours. Luckily, none of us experienced a zombie invasion. However, under a certain light, all of these three things are the same from a mathematical perspective. So what can probability theory say about traffic, queues and zombies? The talk will begin by briefly and simply explaining the three main types of questions in modern probability, namely laws of large numbers, fluctuations and large deviations. Then we will try to give answers for some of this questions: How does traffic evolve? How long will take me to reach my destination when the traffic has a given density? How many highway exits do I need to pass in order to get out of highway traffic? How long will wait in queue and with what probability? Where are the zombies?</abstract>

    <title>Wonderful World of Wheat</title>
    <speaker>Will Roper</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 27 August 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract> Wheat... the gluten tolerant amongst us will encounter it in some form or another (almost) everyday of our lives. In fact, the UK is one of the world leaders in wheat production and consumption. It should therefore be clear that understanding wheat production is an important field of research in agriculture, not only to farmers but consumers, breeders, insurance companies, and the government. In this talk I will endeavour to give a view into a tiny portion of this research, particularly the work I have been undertaking as part of the SimFarm2030 project at Sussex, in partnership with the University of Reading and the Met Office. I will attempt to answer the questions: why is wheat so important? How do you go about modelling it and what do you model? And, most importantly, why on Earth is an astrophysicist working on wheat modelling!? </abstract>

    <title>Black holes and the hot spaghettification of cool doughnuts</title>
    <speaker>Dr Darren Baskill</speaker>
    <date>Thursday, 10 September 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract>Let's take a look at black holes from a purely observational point of view.  I will cover how black holes are discovered, talk about the tools we use to find them, and how black holes look through various telescopes.  I will also tell you the story of how myself and my colleagues discovered a dozen black holes using the XMM-Newton space telescope and the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands. </abstract>

    <title>Building a Universe in a Box</title>
    <speaker>Dr Chris Lovell and Will Roper</speaker>
    <date>Tuesday, 17 November 2020 - 7.00PM</date>
    <abstract> Galaxies are as diverse and complex as people, however they also evolve over distinctly non-human time scales and their unfathomable size means they can’t be poked and prodded in a laboratory. Instead, to unlock the secrets of their formation and evolution, we look out into the Universe using telescopes (such as the Hubble Space Telescope or upcoming Webb Space Telescope). Unfortunately, these only provide a snapshot of a galaxy, frozen in time. To truly understand how galaxies evolve we need something else: simulations! But how do these work? How do you take a computer and reproduce a population of galaxies? In this talk we will show exactly how astrophysicists build these toy Universes, and how they help us understand our own Universe’s past, present and future.</abstract>
